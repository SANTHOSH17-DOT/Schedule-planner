# Idea

1. Monthly calendar

2. Change the month on user's wish (by dropdown or arrow btn).

3. Todo list of a particular date to be displayed on clicking that date on the calendar.
   And also soon after clicking the add btn.

4. Highlight the current date.

5. Digital clock showing current time using Date object.

6. Storing the todo list along with the date on which they are planned.
   > text field to get the to-do
   > div to show the to-dos
7. vanta.js for background effects.
